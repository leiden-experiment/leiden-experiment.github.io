      <h1>Moving sprites with physics</h1><p>It&#39;s always a good idea to tie movement to <em>time</em>. Previously we just set the character to move a fixed amount <em>per frame</em>, but we are ignoring how many frames per second our game is executing!</p>
<p>We could handle movements manually by querying for the <strong>delta time</strong> (the time that has elapsed between this frame an the previous one), but Phaser offer us a more convenient way: the use of a <strong>Physics engine</strong>.</p>
<p>Physics engines are usually expensive in terms of computation, but Phaser has implemented a very fast and small engine named Arcade Physics. It is very limited in features, but it&#39;s enough to handle a platformer game like ours –and we will not get a performance hit!</p>
<p>We will use the physics engine to move sprite, but also –later on– to handle gravity, collision tests, etc.</p>
<p>The important thing to take into account is that each sprite will have a physical <strong>body</strong>, and if this body is moved, rotated, etc. by the physics engine, Phaser will automatically update their rendering properties (like <code>x</code> or <code>y</code>), so we don&#39;t need to keep track of it.</p>
<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
<h3 id="make-the-main-character-use-the-physics-engine-for-movement">Make the main character use the physics engine for movement</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>First we need to create a body for the character. This gets done when we &quot;enable&quot; physics for this sprite. Modify the <code>Hero</code> constructor:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"> function Hero(game, x, y) {
     // ...
     this.game.physics.enable(this);
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Now we just need to make the <code>move</code> method affect the body of the sprite instead of directly modifying its position. What we need is to modify the sprite&#39;s velocity so it can move left or right. Edit the <code>Hero.move</code> method so it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"> Hero.prototype.move = function (direction) {
     const SPEED = 200;
     this.body.velocity.x = direction * SPEED;
 };
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Try this out in the browser! Can you move left and right? Yes? Well done! But now we have a different problem… we need to be able to <em>stop</em> the character!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="stop-the-main-character">Stop the main character</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>We didn&#39;t need to do this before because we were modifying the <em>position</em>, but now we are modifying the <em>velocity</em> –and obviously objects with a non-zero velocity, move. We can stop the character by setting its speed to zero, and we can do that just by passing <code>0</code> as the direction when no key is being pressed:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"> PlayState._handleInput = function () {
     if (this.keys.left.isDown) { // move hero left
         // ...
     }
     else if (this.keys.right.isDown) { // move hero right
         // ...
     }
     else { // stop
         this.hero.move(0);
     }
 };
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prevent-the-main-character-to-get-out-of-the-screen">Prevent the main character to get out of the screen</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>This is a taste of what a physics engine can do for us with very little code from our part. Let&#39;s prevent the main character to move outside the bounds of the screen. In Phaser this can be done by setting a flag in the body. Edit the <code>Hero</code> constructor:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"> function Hero(game, x, y) {
     // ...
     this.body.collideWorldBounds = true;
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="checklist">Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can still move the main character left and right with the arrow keys.</li>
<li>The character stops if no key is being pressed.</li>
<li>The character cannot move out of the screen.</li>
</ul>
