      <h1>Moving forward…</h1><p><strong>Congratulations</strong>! You completed the workshop and have a playable game you can share with other people.</p>
<p>However, you might have noticed that the finished version of the game is a bit more <strong>polished</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It features a loading state (useful for when you publish your game in the Web)</li>
<li>It has a music track playing in the background.</li>
<li>The main character can jump higher or lower depending on how much time the up arrow key was pressed.</li>
<li>The main character features a dying animation.</li>
<li>The main character has a &quot;enter the door&quot; animation for when a level it&#39;s finished.</li>
<li>Camera fade out and fade in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The source code of this version has been provided for you to peek around and learn from it. It doesn&#39;t contain significantly <em>new</em> things, so you should be able to follow it along with the help of <a href="http://phaser.io/docs">Phaser&#39;s documentation</a>.</p>
<p>A good way of learning would be to try to <strong>replicate those features without seeing the code</strong> beforehand. Check out <a href="http://phaser.io/examples">Phaser&#39;s examples</a>, look for tutorials online, answers in online forums, etc.</p>
<p>If you get stuck, or are curious about how a feature was implemented in this case (there&#39;s usually more than just one way of doing things!), you have the <a href="/pizzicato-game.github.io/platformer/js/main.js" download="">full source code</a> at your disposal.</p>
<h2 id="some-tips-to-take-into-account">Some tips to take into account</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You can keep an sprite in the world but remove it from all the physics calculations by disabling its body. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">  this.body.enable = false;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/Phaser.Camera.html"><code>Phaser.Camera</code></a> has methods for fadign in and out.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can subscribe to an <code>onComplete</code> event of an animation or tween to do something once the animation or tween has finished.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Songs are handled with the same class than sound effects, <code>Phaser.Sound</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
