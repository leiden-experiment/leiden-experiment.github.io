**Congratulations**! You completed the workshop and have a playable game you can share with other people.

However, you might have noticed that the finished version of the game is a bit more **polished**:

- It features a loading state (useful for when you publish your game in the Web)
- It has a music track playing in the background.
- The main character can jump higher or lower depending on how much time the up arrow key was pressed.
- The main character features a dying animation.
- The main character has a "enter the door" animation for when a level it's finished.
- Camera fade out and fade in.

The source code of this version has been provided for you to peek around and learn from it. It doesn't contain significantly _new_ things, so you should be able to follow it along with the help of [Phaser's documentation](http://phaser.io/docs).

A good way of learning would be to try to **replicate those features without seeing the code** beforehand. Check out [Phaser's examples](http://phaser.io/examples), look for tutorials online, answers in online forums, etc.

If you get stuck, or are curious about how a feature was implemented in this case (there's usually more than just one way of doing things!), you have the <a href="/platformer/js/main.js" download>full source code</a> at your disposal.

## Some tips to take into account

- You can keep an sprite in the world but remove it from all the physics calculations by disabling its body. For example:

    ```js
    this.body.enable = false;
    ```

- [`Phaser.Camera`](http://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/Phaser.Camera.html) has methods for fadign in and out.

- You can subscribe to an `onComplete` event of an animation or tween to do something once the animation or tween has finished.

- Songs are handled with the same class than sound effects, `Phaser.Sound`.
